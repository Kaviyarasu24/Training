# College Programming Practice Repository  

This repository contains programs I developed while learning various programming languages during my college training. The focus of this repository is on foundational concepts and skills in programming, with code written in **C** and **Python**.  

## üìö About the Repository  
The programs in this repository are a result of coursework and training sessions provided by my college. These exercises were designed to build problem-solving skills and a strong understanding of core programming concepts.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Languages Used  
1. **C**: Focused on understanding low-level programming, memory management, and procedural programming concepts.  
2. **Python**: Explored scripting, object-oriented programming, and working with libraries for automation and problem-solving.

- **/C-Programs**:  
  Contains programs developed in the C programming language. Topics include:  
  - Control structures (if-else, loops)  
  - Functions  
  - Pointers and arrays  
  - File handling  

- **/Python-Programs**:  
  Contains Python scripts focused on:  
  - Basics (variables, control flow, loops)  
  - Functions and modules  
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP)  
  - File I/O

## üöÄ How to Run  
### For C Programs:  
1. Use a C compiler like GCC or any IDE such as Code::Blocks.  
2. Compile the code using the terminal:  
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ./program_name
   ```  

### For Python Scripts:  
1. Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
2. Run the script using the terminal or any IDE:  
   ```bash
   python program_name.py
   ```
